# CodingAdvent25 :christmas_tree:
This Repository contains my code solutions for the "Advent of Code - 2022" activity. The solutions are written in **Python**. 
I can really recommend this activity if you're new to programming, want to learn a new language or just want to improve your skills - as I do with **Py**.

Wanna try it yourself? The description of each day (programming puzzle) can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## Get my code!
**Feel free to have a look into my code** - I would really appreciate it. If you find any code smells or just bad syntax habits -> let me know.

## Merry Christmas and Happy Coding :santa::christmas_tree::computer::vulcan_salute:
